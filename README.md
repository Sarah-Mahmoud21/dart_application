This is a Tic-Tac-Toe Console Application. where you first write your name and then your opponent writes his/her name and then you exchange roles to play.
make sure that this  is 3X3 grid so all input moves must be between 1-9 and in an unsed cell. 
the first player to acheive a win path, wins the game. if it ends with no winners then it's a draw.
finally you can choose to play another time or just quit.
